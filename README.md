# AgriData Explorer: Understanding Indian Agriculture with EDA
AgriData Explorer is a data analysis and visualization project aimed at uncovering trends in Indian agriculture using exploratory data analysis (EDA). By combining Python, SQL, Streamlit, and Power BI, the project delivers insights into crop production patterns, regional diversity, and temporal changes using open agricultural datasets like those from ICRISAT.

🌾 Project Objective
To analyze and visualize agricultural data in India to:

Understand crop and state-level production trends

Explore changes over time in agricultural output

Identify key crops and regional production strengths

Provide interactive tools for data exploration

📊 Key Features
📈 Interactive Power BI dashboards for quick insights

🧮 In-depth Python-based EDA using Jupyter Notebooks

📂 Structured data querying with SQL

🌐 Streamlit dashboard for accessible, web-based exploration

🗺️ Regional and crop-wise insights with visual storytelling

🧑‍🌾 Data Source
ICRISAT Agricultural Statistics Database

(Optional) Other sources: rainfall, irrigation, soil health, etc.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

SQL: SQLite/PostgreSQL

Power BI: Interactive data visualization dashboards

Streamlit: Web app interface for real-time exploration

Jupyter Notebook: For EDA and narrative data exploration
